# Vic Emergencies

This is an effort to port the information from www.emergency.vic.gov.au to a free and open source Android/iPhone app.

## Rationale

I've found that the mobile website tends to crash the android browser.
In addition, although there is a pretty nice looking mobile app available in the play store (commisioned by the victorian government, if I'm not mistaken) it is propriatery, and also requires Google services to be installed so that push notifications can work.
Even if they do fix the issue with push notifications (i.e. allow those of us without Google services installed to use it), I still feel like this is the type of app that should be freely available for the community to develop and participate with.

## Disclaimer

I am _not_ affiliated with the Victorian government, nor any of the organisations that provide information to http://www.emergency.vic.gov.au. Rather, I am just a citizen of Victoria, who would like to see this information available to as many people as possible, in the eaasiest ways possible.

## Terms of use

### Don't rely on the info on this app alone

That is the gist of the tems of service at http://emergency.vic.gov.au/#terms. 
Contary to many other websites terms of service, these are quite easy to read, and I encourage you to have a quick read through.

# Contributing

Please feel free to submit pull requests, issues, feature requests, etc.

# Current Progress

My goal is to start of with the basics, and slowly add features so that it becomes a swiss-army knife of emergency management information.

Currently, the app is able to:

 * List warnings.
 * List incidents.
 * Show warning information.
 * View incidents on map.

In the future, I'd love for it to be able to:

 * Send notifications to the user about incidents (configurable based on severity/proximity/type/etc).
 * Map overview of incidents.
 * Links to http://www.bom.gov.au/vic and relevant pages there.
 * Links to CFA/SES/MFB/DEPI/etc.
 * Links to local ABC radio frequencies, for when there is no internet connectivity available.
 * Probably some other cool stuff.
