The Victorian administrative boundary geoJson was downloaded from the Australian Bureau of Statistics:

http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1259.0.30.0022006?OpenDocument.
(State/Territory Digital Boundaries (ASGC 2006) in ESRI Shapefile Format)

Download that .zip file to this directory, unzip it, and then run `./process.sh` from this directory to
extract the Victorian Boundaries and export them as a geoJSON file.
